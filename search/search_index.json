In general only an array of a few lights e.g. 4 moving heads in a row. A moving head effect will then iterate over 4 lights where each light might do something different (e.g. implement a wave of moving head movement)</li> <li>You need to define channelsPerLight in the layout node setup() - (it is default 3 to support normal LEDs). Currently MoonLight only supports identical moving heads with the same channels. The first light starts at DMX 0 (+1), the second at DMX channelsPerLight (+1) the third on DMX 2*channelsPerLight (+1) and so on. (+1): DMX typically starts at address 1 while MoonLight internal starts with 0... \ud83d\udea7. We are working on a solution to support different lights e.g a mix of 15 channel lights and 32 channel lights etc. You could set channelsPerLight to a higher number as the real lights channels, e.g. 32 so each lights DMX address starts at a multiple of 32.</li> <li>Layout: The layout node also defines which functionality / channels the light support by defining offsets. Currently the following offsets are supported: offsetRGBW, offsetRed, offsetGreen, offsetBlue, offsetWhite, offsetBrightness, offsetPan, offsetTilt, offsetZoom, offsetRotate, offsetGobo, offsetRGBW1, offsetRGBW2, offsetRGBW3, offsetBrightness2 and need to be set in the setup() function.</li> <li>The distinction between physical and virtual layer for moving heads is not useful if you have only 2-4 moving heads. However this is a standard MoonLight feature. It might become useful if you have like 8 (identical) moving heads, 4 left and 4 right of the stage, then you can add a mirror modifier and the virtual layer will only control 4 lights, which then will be mapped to 8 physical lights. In theory you can also have a cube of like 512 moving heads and then exotic modifiers like pinwheel could be used to really go crazy. Let us know when you have one of these setups \ud83d\udea8</li> <li>Moving heads will be controlled using the ArtNed Node. addPin is not needed for moving heads, although you might want to attach LEDs for a visual view of what is send to Art-Net.</li> <li>Effect nodes set light: Currently setRGB, setWhite, setBrightness, setPan, setTilt, setZoom, setRotate, setGobo, setRGB1, setRGB2, setRGB3, setBrightness2 is supported.

MoonModules is a collective of light artist, hardware- and software developers. We love creating DIY lighting solutions based on microcontrollers, mainly ESP32. Our work can be found on GitHub and we use mainly Discord for communications. We develop our products for a large community of light enthousiasts and make products we show to the world, e.g. on art-exhibitions, in venues, or at festivals. See also about. Our flagship product is WLED-MM, a fork of WLED focussing on driving more LEDs, new platforms (e.g. ESP32-P4), better audio and so on. As currenyly most of the MoonModules team are also core developers of WLED, WLED-MM functionality is slowly moving to WLED.</p> <p>Started in 2023 we are also developing a new product based on our experience working with WLED called MoonLight. MoonLight is a modern alternative to WLED, with a modern UI, supporting 1D, 2D and 3D layouts, effects and modifiers, live scripts and led drivers.</p>"},{"location":"moonlight/overview/#why-moonlight","title":"Why MoonLight","text":"<p>So why build MoonLight when we already have WLED(-MM)?</p> <p>This is a personal overview by me (ewowi). It\u2019s not meant to burn down WLED, quite the opposite. I worked on it for years (mainly on 2D: first in WLED SR, then in WLED/WLED, and later in WLED-MM) and I was, and still am, deeply impressed with what it offers. But along the way I ran into some limitations that eventually convinced me to start MoonLight.</p> <ul> <li> <p>UI: extending or modifying the UI is difficult, not only because the code is complex and non-intuitive, but also because of memory and flash constraints. On top of that, WLED has two UI systems: one for the main screen, and another for setup/configuration, which adds complexity. The UI stack is \u201cclassic\u201d HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, without modern concepts like reactive frameworks.</p> </li> <li> <p>ESP8266 support: WLED still supports ESP8266, and that legacy support complicates the codebase a lot. MoonLight takes a different stance: if you need ESP8266, use an older WLED release. But don\u2019t hold back development for it, most advanced features won\u2019t fit on the ESP8266 anyway.</p> </li> <li> <p>Outdated libraries: WLED relies on older versions of FastLED, ArduinoJson, ESP-IDF, and others. MoonLight\u2019s philosophy is to keep libraries up to date. \u201cDon\u2019t change what works\u201d only delays the inevitable, you\u2019re forced to upgrade eventually.</p> </li> <li> <p>Effects and fixture dimensions: WLED effects are designed around 1D and 2D, with a lot of hardcoding. MoonLight supports up to 3D at the core, with no hardcoded constraints. An effect doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d the fixture or its size, so you can run a 1D effect on 3D, or 2D on 1D, without issues. MoonLight doesn\u2019t use effect IDs, an effect is a class (Node). Modifiers, layouts, and drivers are also Node types. This eliminates hacks like shared data, limited effect controls, effect metadata, virtual strips, expand1D, etc. (some of which I originally introduced in WLED, sorry \ud83d\ude1c).</p> </li> <li> <p>Mapping system: WLED\u2019s mapping is based on strips and panels, and requires hacks to handle shapes like rings or hexagons. 3D isn\u2019t supported. MoonLight uses \u201cinverse mapping\u201d: instead of placing LEDs on a grid, you just define their coordinates, and the system maps everything internally.</p> </li> <li> <p>Technical debt: WLED has accumulated a lot of code that \u201cjust evolved.\u201d Audio reactive is the clearest example. It\u2019s hard to maintain, and in practice only a few people really can. WLED started with a strong architecture, but that hasn\u2019t evolved much over time. (Yes, I share some of the blame \ud83d\ude48)</p> </li> <li> <p>Too big to change: WLED has grown so large, with so many users, that making deep architectural changes is nearly impossible. The last major thing I worked on in WLED (2023) was \u201cSuperSync\u201d, linking multiple microcontrollers to drive a single fixture, inspired by drone swarms. I quickly hit the system\u2019s boundaries, and the plans we had seemed unachievable within WLED.</p> </li> <li> <p>What I love most in WLED: UserMods \u2764\ufe0f! Small, isolated pieces of code you can enable or disable, each with its own UI integration. This makes WLED incredibly versatile, with a huge library of UserMods. MoonLight originally was named \u201cStarMod\u201d (or *Mod: everything as a module). That idea evolved into the Nodes class: self-contained objects that initialize, run, expose controls, and can be destructed.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"moonlight/overview/#current-status","title":"Current status","text":"<p>As of fall 2025, MoonLight can best be described as having its foundation solidly in place.</p> <p>Earlier releases involved major structural changes that often required fresh installs or renaming.
